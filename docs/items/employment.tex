    {Sept 2016}
    {Dec 2020}
    {During these years I studied different problems on Harmonic Analysis, from singular integral operators to Poincaré-Sobolev inequalities both in Euclidean and abstract metric spaces. This culminated in the development of a new method to get Poincaré-Sobolev inequalities in different settings. This is collected in my thesis \href{https://bird.bcamath.org/handle/20.500.11824/1206}{dissertation}}
