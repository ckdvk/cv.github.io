    "description": "During these years I studied different problems on Harmonic Analysis, from singular integral operators to Poincaré-Sobolev inequalities both in Euclidean and abstract metric spaces. This culminated in the development of a new method to get Poincaré-Sobolev inequalities in different settings. This is collected in my thesis \\href{https://bird.bcamath.org/handle/20.500.11824/1206}{dissertation}"
